        &emsp;Having spent majority of my life running a retail business, even
        though there were highs and lows, I realized that I was not getting the
        result for the effort that I was putting in. There are so many different
        factors that could change the course of businesses, for better or worse.
        I have decided to have a career-change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I have always thought Information Technology was the
        future, the high income that an IT person makes was one of the reasons
        why I wanted to run into a tech-field, to be honest. Since I quit
        running a business, I have been spending much time learning new things,
        such as basic computer skills, document management software, analytics,
        and web development. I fell in love with web development because the
        result is there when you follow the rules and add creativity to them. It
        does not lie.
      </p>

        There are always challenges. It gets harder. You have to learn{' '}
        <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, libraries
        like <code>React</code>, frameworks like <code>bootstrap</code> or{' '}
        <code>tailwind</code>, <code>Typescript</code>, and so on. So much stuff
        and so little time. tech companies are laying off their employees, and
        ChatGPT will be replacing programmers, they say. Companies are hiring
        people with years of experience and with so many different skills. It
        makes me want to go back to my younger years and start early. I am still
        learning because I am not perfect and keep on forgetting what I have
        learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proud that I am doing this at this age. I think I have a
        young mind and I am smart. And I have a belief that anyone who hires me never wants to
        let me go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am trying to be hired as a front-end developer, and my ultimate
        goal is to become a full-stack web developer.
